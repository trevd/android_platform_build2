Build2 - Android Build System Extensions
----------------------------------------

1. The Android Build System 
The Android Build System (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/) add custom 
functions to the shell environment to help manage the AOSP source tree. 

This is enabled using the "source build/envsetup.sh".

2. Modifying the Android Core Projects ( or Why Forking AOSP Repo's is a bad idea )
Unless you have commit rights or are an active contributor to the AOSP project you
can often find your changes made to the main AOSP projects are made obsolete or become
a management "nightmare" if you wish to keep in sync with the master branch.
The build system is no different.

3. The "Light Touch" Approach.
I've found taking a "light touch" approach to core project modification is the 
easy way of maintaining managability of sources between major updates and code changes.
The main facets of this approach are 

a. Minimal changes to existing source file.
b. Super/Sub Classing Platfrom functionality
c. Using Device and vendor Overlays 
d. Create New Projects to extend existing project while leaving the original untouch

4. Build2 - Build System Extensions
The Build2 Directory follows the "light touch" approach and provides a wrapper for
the AOSP envsetup.sh which will allow modification of existing functions and also 
provides a clean space to add new functionality, while maintain repo sync compatibility

5. Using Build2 

source .build2/envsetup.sh

This will run build/envsetup.sh internally.
